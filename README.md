# Thief 1 like movement
In this project I tried to create movement as in thief 1 game. It's going to be refactored in future because the way it was writted back in the days was aweful.

Currently project includes:
- edge climbing
- side movement on edges
- climbing vertical pipes
- climbing up ropes (they are static and do not have any rope physics)
- tightrope
